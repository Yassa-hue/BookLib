# BookLib

This is an online book library and reader. 
You can create account, browse books, add book to your collection and read books in sessions so that if you return to the page you stopped at. You need C#, .net and SQLite to run this project.

### In this project:
* Functional programming : This project is designed by FP from A to Z. I used the power of FP to make the code testable, extendable and readable.
* Databases : Indexes are used to maintain high performance as the number of records grows.
* C# : Intensive use of C# function delegations, function composition and containers.  

To run this project properly you have to move the database file ` ./BookLib/book.db` to ` BookLib/bin/Debug/net7.0` in order to be accessible by the code.
